# Sign Language and Hand Gesture Recognition System

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach was used to recognize American Sign Languages alphabets, digits and static words. The transfer learning model - Inception V3 is then used which is pretrained on ImageNet dataset and fine tuned the later layers on the target dataset.

# Sub-Utterance Level Language Identification on bilingual code-switched speech

Sub-utterance level language identification (SLID) is an automatic process of recognizing the spoken language in a code switched (CS) utterance at the sub-utterance level. <br />
We designed a wav2vec2 based approach, which captures suprasegmental phonemic temporal pattern in the pre-training stage and merges it to capture language specific suprasegmental evidence in the finetuning stage.
